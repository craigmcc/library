# Shared Sidebar

Family of components used to compose a Sidebar, as similar in API
as possible to the `Navbar` and `Nav` family of components in
[React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/reactbootstrap) (version 2.7.4 or later).

The implementation avoids as much react-bootstrap magic as possible,
because much of that is not exported, and none of that is documented.
